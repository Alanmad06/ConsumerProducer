| This project implements the classic Producer-Consumer Problem using Java's multithreading capabilities. It serves as an educational example to demonstrate thread synchronization, inter-thread communication, and the handling of shared resources in concurrent programming.â€‹

ðŸ“š Overview
The Producer-Consumer Problem is a fundamental example in concurrent programming. It involves two types of threads:â€‹

Producers: Generate data and place it into a shared buffer.

Consumers: Retrieve data from the shared buffer for processing.â€‹

Proper synchronization is crucial to prevent issues such as:â€‹

Race Conditions: Multiple threads accessing and modifying shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.

Deadlocks: Two or more threads waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other.

Starvation: A thread waiting indefinitely to acquire a resource because other threads are continuously acquiring it.â€‹

This implementation uses Java's synchronized methods along with wait() and notify() to manage thread communication and ensure safe access to the shared buffer.â€‹

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Language: Java

Concurrency: Java Threads, synchronized, wait(), notify()

IDE Support: NetBeans (includes nbproject/ configuration)â€‹ |
